This theme is used to test the alternate color functions that generate `primary`,`secondary`, etc. colors.

To be able to use this theme, make sure your discourse instance is set to this branch: https://github.com/discourse/discourse/tree/new-css-variable-functions

This theme generates a "color palette" similar to the one in the styleguide on theme creator above the Header of the site.
